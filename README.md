APOC-RPG What is it?
========

This plugin is meant to give full control over the map generation, items, drop tables, mobs, and more on a minecraft server both forge and vanilla. The goal is to give you custom control over aspects of the server so you can customize the look and feel of the server for a more RPG like gaming experience.

Features:

*Custom Items | Custom names, enchantments, abilities, materials, etc.

*Custom Mobs | Bosses, HP Control, Boss Loot, Custom worn gear for mobs, etc.

*Custom Dungeons | Build your own dungeons, save the schematic with world edit, throw it in RPG and watch it spawn on the server!

*Dungeon Loot | Place chests in your dungeon design and when it spawns every chest will be filled with randomized loot.

*Gems | Find a socketed armor, tools, or weapon and combine a Gem into it to add special abilities and upgrades! These gems can be upgraded to increase their effect.

*Armor Sets | Get a complete set of 4 armor pieces and get bonuses for wearing the entire set of armor!

*Skills | Ever heard of MCMMO? This is better. Level up by defeating players and monsters and apply your skill points into abilities.

*Stats | Like the skills, when you level up you will get stat attributes as well. You can apply these to Strength, Dexterity, and Recovery. Strength will increase your health while dexterity will increase your movement speed, breathe under water, and dodge chance. And recovery will increase your life and armor regeneration times.

*Full Economy Support | Looted a boss or dungeon? Dont need any of this junk? Sell it! Want to use your new found cash? Buy new items with it!

*Salvaging | You got a lot of loot from those dungeons and you are pretty low on ingots and diamonds. How about you salvage all that stuff to solve that problem?
