APOC-RPG What is it?
========

This project is an official plugin designed and programmed by the [Apocalyptic Gaming Network's](http://apocgaming.org) development team.

This plugin enables many RPG like features into minecraft such as:
- Randomized naming for items.
- Randomized enchantments for items.
- Randomized equipped gear for mobs, making mobs more difficult.
- Complete economy integration. Works great with [APOC-Payday](https://github.com/Zilacon/APOC-Payday)!
- Many commands that allow you to customize your gear or purchase items from the plugin for a cost.
 - Purchase item names
 - Purchase item lores
 - Purchase item enchantments
 - Purchase sockets
 - Purchase socket gems
 - Purchase identification books
 - Purchase a randomized item
 - Pay for repairs on your gear.
 - Pay for disenchanting your gear. This gives you experience based off the enchantments.
 - Pay for salvaging your gear. This gives you materials back based on the durability of the item.
 - Sell any unwanted gear found in dungeons or mobs for economy.
- A socketing system that drops or spawns "gems" that can upgrade your gear with special effects and increase the gems effects by socketing with another gem of the same type.
- A dungeon spawning system that allows you to create the dungeons you choose. You make the design, size, spawners, signs, chests, and you port that into a schematic and our plugin will actively spawn your design into the world while filling all chests within the schematic with random customized loot!
- This is a good replacement for dungeon MODS. Forge mods that deal with dungeon generation such as BetterDungeons, Ruins, BattleTowers, SecretDungeons, ETC. Use much more resources and are much more demanding then a plugin. This plugin can replace pretty much any dungeon generating mod by simply throwing some schematics into the plugin folder.
- Anti-Exploits:
 - Custom items will not drop from spawned in mobs. This includes spawners, commands, and spawn eggs.
 - Chests in dungeons "lock" allowing new players to find the dungeon and get loot.
 - Once a chest has been opened and closed that player can no longer open or destroy that chest.
 - Repairing an item locks it, disallowing players to sell the item for economy.
 - Customizing an item makes it player bound. Disallowing players to drop the item or place the item into a different players inventory.
- Disable the dungeon spawning or mob drops/mob equips per world.
- Do you like customization? So do we! Complete plugin control in the config with on/off switches for everything to save resources on your server to customizing the amount of items that spawn, drop, dungeon spawn chance, economy cost for everything, and much much more!

This plugin is all about customizing the game to its fullest for dungeons and gear while giving you full control to change and modify every aspect of the plugin within the configuration.
